                                Many of these problems are not serious. It is important to know how to help your sick baby, and to know the warning signs for more serious problems. Trust your intuition - if you are worried about your baby, call your health care provider right away.

            What do I need to know about my child’s medicines?
<br>
                Your child’s doctor and your pharmacist can answer questions about prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. (OTC medicines are medicines that you can buy without a prescription from your doctor.)
    <br>            
                Here are some things you should know about each of the medicines that your child takes by mouth (oral medicines):
        <br>        
                    The name of the medicine
                    What the medicine is for
                    The dose (amount) of the medicine to give
                    What measuring device to use to give your child the medicine
                    The number of times a day the medicine should be given
                    The times of the day the medicine should be given
                    Whether the medicine can be given with food
                    The number of days the medicine should be given
                    How you will know the medicine is working
